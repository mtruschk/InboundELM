# GitHub Modeling
How to:
- create a draw.io diagram in draw.io
- use the btelligentADAPT shape library
- save the diagram directly to GitHub, in folder "drawio"
- mind your branch!
- synchronize and generate metadate, png and documentation with process_md.bat (run it on your local machine in the associated folder)
